This is the implementation of the Adaptive XGBoost classifier as described in
 our forthcoming paper:

> Montiel, Jacob, Mitchell, Rory, Frank, Eibe, Pfahringer, Bernhard, 
> Abdessalem, Talel, and Bifet, Albert. “AdaptiveXGBoost for Evolving 
> Data Streams”. In:IJCNN’20. International Joint Conference on Neural
> Networks. 2020. Forthcoming.

This implementation is written in Python 3 and built on top of 
[scikit-multiflow](https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow).

To run the example:

```shell
python adaptive_xgboost_example.py
```
